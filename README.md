# CV-Green-Screen-Processor-
Removing the background from an image with a green screen and adding it to a background using Open CV, Python
## 📌 Overview  
This project implements **green screen extraction and image composition** using **computer vision techniques**. It processes images with green backgrounds, extracts foreground elements, and seamlessly inserts them into new scenes using **affine transformations** and depth-based blending.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Green screen extraction** using color thresholding  
- **Object segmentation** with connected components and bounding box detection  
- **Affine transformations** for object insertion  
- **Depth-based compositing** for realistic scene integration  
- **Custom scene generation** using multiple foreground objects  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)  
- **NumPy** (for matrix operations)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)  
- **SciPy** (for depth maps)
